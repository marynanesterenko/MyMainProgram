What is Collections?

Collections - it is a list of things.
Collections is the Framework - therefore we cannot use the primitive Data Types,
                               when working with Collections.
SDETs -> ArrayList
DEVs -> LinkedList


DATA STRUCTURE GROUPS:
Linear:
static:
- Array

dynamic:
- Linked List
  *
- Stack
- Queue

Non-linear:
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL, Red-Black Tree)
- Graphs
- Tables
- HashSet
- HashMap

** the parameter of constructor is the value of the instance variable
