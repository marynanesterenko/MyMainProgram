What is Collections? - java Collections are like containers that group multiple items into one unit.

Collections - it is a list of things.
Collections is the Framework - therefore we cannot use the primitive Data Types,
                               when working with Collections.
SDETs -> ArrayList
DEVs -> LinkedList

ArrayList and HashMap are commonly used in Selenium Automation tests.

What is the LinkedList?
A linked list is a Collection of Objects linked together by references from an Object to another Object.
So the basic LinkedList, or commonly called "singly linked List" consists of nodes,
where each node contains one or more data fields AND a reference to the next node.

Itâ€™s a linear Data Structure or a sequence of data Objects, where elements are not stored in neighboring memory locations.
The elements are linked using pointers to form a chain. Each element is a separate Object, called a node.
Each node has two items: a data field and a reference to the next node. The entry point in a linked list is called the head.
Where the list is empty, the head is a null reference and the last node has a reference to null.

A linked list is a dynamic data structure, where the number of nodes is not fixed, and the list has the ability to grow and shrink on demand.



DATA STRUCTURE GROUPS:
Linear:
static:
- Array

dynamic:
- LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue

Non-linear:
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL, Red-Black Tree)
- Graphs
- Tables
- HashSet
- HashMap
- Heap

** the parameter of Constructor is the value of the instance variable
