SET

1. What is SET?
   -> SET is an unsorted Collection of Objects(mutable and unmutable), in which duplicate values cannot be stored;
   -> SET is an Interface, which is present in the java.util package and extends the Collection Interface;
   -> SET cannot contain itself an an element;
   -> when creating a SET, we can prohibit, or restrict, the Set to contain specified by us types of elements (i.e. null);
   -> if that restriction is violated - we get an unchecked exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException;
