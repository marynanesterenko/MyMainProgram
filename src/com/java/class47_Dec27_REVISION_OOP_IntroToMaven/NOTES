MAVEN:

1. What is the purpose?
- we need Maven in order to manage our dependencies:
    we have a lot of libraries:
      * java v1.8
      * selenium (54 - 57) v3.14.59
      * testng v6.8
      * cucumber v 6.2
      * junit (2) v3.4
      * common io
      * apache poi
      * rest assured
      * sql-java

- we need Maven to automate the "build process":
    ("build steps")
    * turn on the server
    * compile code
    * run the code
    * package the code
    * deploy the code on the server
    * compile the tests
    * run tests
    * generate the report
    * email the report

- we need Maven to help us unify our work - it provides a built-in Project Structure

Maven folders:

".idea" is used by IntelliJ and we do not touch that folder any time during our career
"External Libraries" - we do not use that either, that is generated by Maven
src
-> main
   -> java          - we keep the code here (Developer's code)
   -> resources     - we keep the data here (App Data: images, prices, etc.)
-> src              - test code (SDET's code)
   -> java          - test data
