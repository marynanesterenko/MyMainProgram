- the reason the OOP concept was created is because the developers wanted to
eliminate the gap between the IT and the real world;
(minimize the difference between what we can do in real world and the coding world)

- "C" language is the POP - procedure oriented programming language;

- Object is an instance of the Class:
    * each Object has their own space
    * Properties / Attributes / Variables
    * Behavior / Action / Methods
