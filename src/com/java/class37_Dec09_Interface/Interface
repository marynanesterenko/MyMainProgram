INTERFACE:
- API
- UI

is to create a contract
2- Why do we need constructor in abstract class?

	A constructor in an abstract class can be used to initialize your class for example if you use a final attribute. And the constructor from your subclass can call one constructor of the abstract class.

4- What is use of interface? (use of interface contract with parent class), use contract word

	Every time you implement an interface (or override a method from a parent class, same thing), you need to respect the contract of that interface. Respecting the contract means that you cannot throw more exceptions than in the interface declaration.
	In both cases, Interface is the contract, and Parent is the implementation

From the Java Language Specification, ยง8.2: Constructors, static initializers, and instance initializers are not members and therefore are not inherited.
